# Scent from Heaven 
## Another cooking game

This is a game I'm making for the two week arcade jam with the theme "loopholes".
You have to go around to different rooms to collect the ingredients needed to make different recipies.
When talking with people to ask for ingredients, you have to pick up hidden answers to work around/fund the loophole in whatever restriction is stopping them from helping you.
Note: movement is the only thing working now
